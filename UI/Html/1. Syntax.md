HTML Syntax
===================

- Use soft tabs with two spaces—they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
- Nested elements should be indented once (two spaces).
- Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.
- Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements.
- Don’t omit optional closing tags (e.g. `</li> or </body>`).
